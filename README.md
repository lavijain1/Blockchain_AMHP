# DoS Attack Simulation in Anonymous Multi-Hop Payment Channel Networks

## Project Overview

This project focuses on simulating and analyzing the impact of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on Anonymous Multi-Hop Payment Channel Networks. The goal is to develop a robust framework that allows the detailed study of attack scenarios and their effects on:

- Payment routing efficiency
- Channel liquidity
- Overall network security

### Key Features:
- **Attack Simulation**: Designed a simulation system to model Denial of Service attacks.
- **Mitigation Analysis**: Evaluated various mitigation strategies against DoS attacks.
- **Network Behavior Modeling**: Created a framework to replicate real-world network conditions and analyze vulnerabilities.
  
By using this system, researchers and developers can gain insights into the potential risks and responses in anonymous payment networks.
